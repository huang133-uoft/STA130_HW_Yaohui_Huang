    "The key factor that determines whether an idea or statement can be examined and tested statistically is measurability, which refers to wheather the data can be collected, analyzed, and compared in the form of quantifiable variables which obeys the priciple of statistical analysis. There are few key criterias that a good null hypothesis should satisfy, for example specified with a clear condition, testable when proving it's wheather true or false, neutrality and universality. Null hypothesis is a default assumption which often states that the result is no effect, nor difference or no relationship with the variables for testing. An alternative hypothesis is everything else differet from the null hypothesis, which usually states that the variables being studied does have an effect on the final result. It stands for a possibility that the null hypothesis is not correct. "

When calculating a p=value, we assume the null hypothesis is true, this helps to evaluate how the observed data is different from the assumption. If the p-value is small, it indicates the extreme data would be unusual from the null hypothesis, and the null hypothesis is rejected; if the p-value is large, then the observation satisfies the null hypothesis, and the null hypothesis is proved since we failed to reject it."

This is because, when the null hypothesis is true, there's a known dirstribution for the statistic being tested, which discribes how the data point will spread under the 'no effect' situation. During a hypothesis test, we build a test statistic from the observed sample data which summarized the how far the data should spread. After comparing the observed data and expected data under the null hypothsis, p-value is calculated to indicate the probability of the observed values being extreme from the test values. For conclusion, if the null hypothesis is true, the chance for observations to have a extreme value would be small. \n",

Initially, a two-sided hypothesis test was implemented, comparing the observed test statistic (the proportion of patients who showed improvement in health scores) against the null hypothesis (where the vaccine has no effect and improvements are random). The comparison used the absolute difference between the observed and simulated statistics relative to the null hypothesis, accounting for extremity in both directions.\n",

    "The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether STA130 students are able to taste the order of pouring of the tea or not, in order to address this problem, the statistical hypothesis test is applied to compare the assumption and the observed statistic. First, a one-sample-z-test for a propotion is performed, which include the steps of assume null hypothesis(p=0.5), calculated the test statistic(49/80 = 0.6125) and determine the p-value. A conclusion can be given after we analyze the p-value calculated."

    "Imagining a World Where the Null Hypothesis is True: When calculating a p-value, the assumption is made that the null hypothesis is true to evaluate how likely the observed data would be under this assumption. This helps in deciding whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on the extremity of the data.\n",
    "What a p-value is: A p-value represents the probability of obtaining a result as extreme, or more extreme, than the observed data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value suggests evidence against the null hypothesis, while a large p-value indicates that the data is not unusual under the null hypothesis. It does not measure the probability that the null hypothesis is true or false, nor does it quantify the size or importance of an effect.\n",

    "https://chatgpt.com/share/66fedad8-2fc0-800c-99a7-b23227c2978b\n",
    "The observed test statistic is compared to the sampling distribution of the test statistic under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. If the observed value falls near the center of the distribution, it suggests that the data aligns with the null hypothesis. However, if the observed statistic falls in the tails (indicating an extreme value), it suggests the result is unusual under the null hypothesis. This comparison helps determine the p-value, with more extreme test statistics leading to smaller p-values and stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",

    "In this session, a simulation was conducted to estimate a p-value for a study on head-tilting preferences among kissing couples. The null hypothesis assumed no preference for tilting direction, with a 50/50 chance of tilting left or right. The observed data showed that 80 out of 124 couples tilted their heads to the right, a proportion of 64.5%.\n",
    "A binomial model representing the 50/50 probability assumption was used, and 10,000 trials were run. The resulting p-value was 0.001, indicating that the likelihood of observing 80 or more right tilts, under the assumption of no preference, is just 0.1%.\n",
    "This low p-value suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, implying a possible preference for tilting to the right when kissing.\n",

    "The session covered the limitations of using p-values in hypothesis testing. It was explained that a p-value cannot definitively prove whether a null hypothesis is true or false. Instead, a smaller p-value provides stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, but it remains probabilistic. In the context of Fido's innocence or guilt, a low p-value suggests evidence against innocence but doesn't definitively prove guilt, and a high p-value suggests weak evidence for guilt but doesn't definitively prove innocence. Hypothesis testing involves probabilistic reasoning rather than absolute certainty.\n",

    "https://chatgpt.com/share/670dfaee-8928-800c-ace7-7669b805e4ca\n",
    "This session focused on refining the hypothesis testing approach, transitioning from a two-sided to a one-sided test. Initially, a two-sided hypothesis test was implemented, comparing the observed test statistic (the proportion of patients who showed improvement in health scores) against the null hypothesis (where the vaccine has no effect and improvements are random). The comparison used the absolute difference between the observed and simulated statistics relative to the null hypothesis, accounting for extremity in both directions.\n",
    "Next, the code was adjusted to perform a one-sided hypothesis test. This test only considers whether the observed statistic is greater than the hypothesized value, focusing on one direction of extremity. This change leads to a smaller p-value, as it only considers deviations in one direction, unlike the two-sided test, which looks at both.\n",
    "The discussion clarified that a one-tailed test typically results in a smaller p-value compared to a two-tailed test, making it easier to reject the null hypothesis in the one-sided case, but should only be used when the direction of the effect is clearly hypothesized.\n",
