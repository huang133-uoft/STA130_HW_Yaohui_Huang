    "As the evaluating critiria, GEO_rural_urban and LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_emptiness are introduced to be analyzed, which reflects the degree of emptiness. The variable GEO_rural_urban is obtained by asking 'What best describes the community you live in?', and have values of 'large urban', 'medium city', 'small city/down', 'rural area', which roughly classifies the living enviroments. The variable LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_emptiness record the respondents' feeling about emptiness, which has values of 'Yes', 'Presented', 'More or less' and 'No'. Stacked bar chart would be the most useful visualization method for both of the variables, since these two variables show values in form of categories, and a bar chart would directly visualize the distribution of each categories for each variable, with each bar representing a category. \n",

After performing summarization and removing the missing values, stacked bar charts would be clear to show and easy to compare the distribution between diffferent categories, and provide a result of whether the samples from large urban areas have a higher sense of emptiness and loneliness or not. A group of bar charts can be appliedin order to summarize these variables, which best shows the distribution of responese with each group of GEO_rural_urban such as 'large urban'. Each bar can represent a category in GEO_rural_urban and the segements can show the categories of responeses. \n",

' DEMO_indentity_newcomers can be visualized by bar charts, with two bars one representing 'Newcomers' and one representing 'Others', and the y-axis shows the amount of samples in each categories. This chart clearly shows the amount of samples in the 'Newcomers' group. The variable WELLNESS_life_satisfication measures the scores of life satisfication from the respondents, which has the values in integers on a scale of 1-10, where 10 has the most greatest life statisfication. This variable can be visualized using a histogram, which best shows the frequency of each integer score values in the range 1 to 10.
